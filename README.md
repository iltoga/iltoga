👋  Hi, I’m @iltoga and I am an software engineer with 30+ years of experience in the field (yes, I'm seasoned, but that's okay!).

👀  I’m interested in cryptography, decentralised systems, surf and snowboard/ski trips, yummy receipes and cultures different from mine (I am Italian, living in Bali with my family).

🌱  I’m currently developing in Python amd Nextjs especially working with LLMs amd have strong backend skills with my GoLang and Java too, with which I've developed micro-services applications for some years. I also do some FE (UI/UX) in react/react native, nextjs and flutter, though I am stronger in backend development.

💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on projects that have a potential positive impact on our life, especially in the field of healthcare, privacy and data ownership/accessibility, such as decentralised systems (not only blockchains..), cryptography applied to data and integration between legacy systems and ai through LLMs (generative ai).

Throughout my long journey in IT, I began as a CX Cobol developer, working with IBM 3090 and AS/400 mainframes. Then I continued as a system administrator (MCSA) on Microsoft Servers in physical data centers (before "the cloud") and went back to my passion for coding. Over the past 10 years, I've witnessed the transition from structured programming to object-oriented and then to functional programming and obviously 'the rise of AI', from which we are already all users and slaves ;)

I've experienced the evolution of computers from mainframes to cloud services, from 8-bit single-core to 64-bit multicore home systems, and from BBS terminal archives and newsgroups to the internet and social networks. 

Despite all the advancements, including the recent rise of AI, I believe the most significant revolution in the field has been the way open source and its community have evolved over the past decade. This growth has made a wealth of information and knowledge available for free to anyone with internet access, regardless of whether they are in the US, EU, Russia, or a developing country.

The open-source community is non-discriminatory and boundary-less: everyone is welcome, and when someone faces bullying, others typically step in to help.

Open Source is real freedom in our time! :)

👋 Hi, I’m @iltoga and I am an IT specialist with 30+ years of experience in the field (yeah I am old, I know...).
👀 I’m interested in cryptography, decentralised systems, surf and snowboard/ski trips, yummy vegetarian receipes and cultures different from mine (I am Italian, but currently living in Bali with my family).
🌱 I’m currently learning Rust lang. My production language right now is GoLang and I've coded for some years in Java (spring boot), php (yii, f3 and a little of symphony), javascript (react and angular) and many other old structured languages (Basic, VisualC, Delphi, etc.. ;) ).
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects (better if open source) that have a potential positive impact on our life and future, especially in the field of privacy and data ownership/accessibility, such as decentralised systems (not only blockchains ;) ) and cryptography applied to data.

Throughout my extensive journey as an IT specialist, I began as a CX Cobol developer and then became a system operator, working with IBM 3090 and AS/400 mainframes. I continued as a system administrator (MCSA) for Microsoft Servers in physical data centers before returning to my passion for coding. Over the past 10 years, I've witnessed the transition from structured programming to object-oriented and then to functional programming.

I've experienced the evolution of computers from mainframes to cloud services, from 8-bit single-core to 64-bit multicore home systems, and from BBS terminal archives and newsgroups to the internet and social networks. Despite all these advancements, including the recent rise of AI, I believe the most significant revolution in the field has been the way open source and its community have evolved over the past decade. This growth has made a wealth of information and knowledge available for free to anyone with internet access, regardless of whether they are in the US, EU, Russia, or a developing country.

The open-source community is non-discriminatory and boundary-less: everyone is welcome, and when someone faces bullying, others typically step in to help.

Open Source is real freedom in our time! :)

- 👋 Hi, I’m @iltoga and I am an IT specialist with 30+ years of experience in the field (yeah I am old, I know...).
- 👀 I’m interested in cryptography, decentralised systems, surf and snowboard/ski trips, yummy vegetarian receipes and cultures different from mine (I am Italian, but currently living in Bali with my family).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust lang. My production language right now is GoLang and I've coded for some years in Java (spring boot), php (yii, f3 and a little of symphony), javascript (react and angular) and many other old structured languages (Basic, VisualC, Delphi, etc.. ;) ).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects (better if open source) that have a potential positive impact on our life and future, especially in the field of privacy and data ownership/accessibility, such as decentralised systems (not only blockchains ;) ) and cryptography applied to data.

In my long path as IT specialist I've started as CX Cobol developer, then system operator, working on IBM 3090 and AS/400 mainframes, 
continued as system administrator (MCSA) of Microsoft Servers in phisical datacenters and went back to my passion for coding again, where I saw the change from structured, to OO to functional programming, in the past 10 years.
I've lived through the evolution of computers from mainframees to cloud services, from 8 bit single core to 64 bit multicore home systems, 
from BBS terminal archives and newsgroups to Internet and social networks, but still.. I believe the biggest revolution in the field, had been in the way 
open source and its community evolved in the past decade, making so much information and knowledge available, for free, to everyone who has access to Internet, 
no matter if he/she is in the US, EU, Russia, or a developing Country.
The Open Source community doesn't discriminate, nor has borders: everyone is accepted and when someone is bullied, usually others come to his rescue.

Open Source is real freedom in our time! :)
